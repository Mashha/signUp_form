# Sign up Form

## Introduction
A simple sign up form, with very little javascript. I learned how preventDefault works and I checked if passwords were a match, all the rest of the necessary parts were in html. 

I made the design first in figma and then with css and it is mobile friendly. I have to say i enjoyed this project even though it was simple, especially because i love css.
